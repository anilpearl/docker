Always start dockerfile with a FROM 

make a DockerFile first and then from that directory run:
 docker build -t centos7:latest .


add user "user" and /bin/bash as default command: This will make an entry point for the container
RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash user

if you want to access this container as a root user you have to attach to this container by:
 docker exec -u 0 -it hardcore_austin /bin/bash
-u 0 ==>says that you want to access as root 

After you create USER in Docker file the control goes to the "user" from the "root"

So the order of execution matters
Linear from top to bottom
